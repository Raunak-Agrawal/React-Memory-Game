# React Memory Game

## Simple memory game

This is my first approach for the React library based project. This is a simple card matching game project where you can start my matching the cards arranged in random order. If all cards are matched, then you win the game.

The code consists of two components.

- Icon Component
- App Component

The array of images is stored in a character.json file.
